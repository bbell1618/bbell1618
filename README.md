## About

I like taking complex, partly messy systems and making them work reliably in the real world.

My background spans:

- Scientific instruments at **RheoSense**, where I owned build/calibration/QC flows for the Initium viscometer line and led the productization of a stalled chip-cleaning accessory.  
- NPI and documentation tooling at **ZEISS Microscopy**, creating service docs and Python-based automation for microscopy instruments.  
- Independent hardware work, designing and shipping small devices and fixtures using **CAD, FDM 3D printing, and Arduino-class microcontrollers**.  
- Systems & automation work at **Golden Era**, where I designed a Market Matrix and AI-backed tools that turn a legacy, inbox-driven operation into a structured system.

I’m currently looking for mid-level **Systems / R&D / Product Development Engineer** roles working on scientific instruments, lab automation platforms, or related hardware-centric systems.

## Selected Projects

- **Chip Cleaning Station – Prototype → Product (sample code & analysis)**  
  Small, sanitized example of how I would model the data, tests, and build/test flows for turning an accessory from prototype into a shippable product.

- **Initium Build/Test Flow – Simulation & Analysis**  
  Code and notebooks that simulate/visualize build/test sequences and acceptance criteria for an instrument-like system.

- **Embedded Device & Fixture – 3D-Printed + Arduino**  
  Firmware, CAD, and documentation for a small embedded device and its 3D-printed enclosure/fixture (representative of my independent product-development work).

- **Market Matrix & ACORD Auto-Filler (Synthetic Data)**  
  Example implementation of a Market Matrix and ACORD form auto-filler using synthetic data, showing how I use Python + simple automation to encode complex business rules.
